[To be done]
- Check/update only changed registers from froms for all models
- do not expose irrelevant fields suc"h user password when retrieving objects to the front
- Take a look about 'Bundle' to avoid add js into index.html. commonjs
- Backend crud does not update all the fields, its need to be implmented in frontend first.
